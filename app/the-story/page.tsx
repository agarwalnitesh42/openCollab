        <h1>About OpenCollab</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to <strong>OpenCollab</strong>! We're a group of cool, young developers who came together with one mission: to create an
          awesome platform specifically for launching developer tools. We believe in collaboration and making the internet better for devs
          everywhere.
        </p>
        <h2>The Team</h2>
        <p>We're lucky to have some amazing contributors on board:</p>
        <ul>

          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          We realized that launching dev tools wasn't always easy or fair on platforms like Product Hunt. So we thought, &quot;Why not build
          our own platform just for devs?&quot; And so, OpenCollab was born!
        </p>
        <p>
          Our project is all about being open and collaborative - that's why we've made it super simple to list your dev tool. Plus, users
          can only vote or comment after logging in with their GitHub accounts, keeping things genuine and focused.
        </p>
